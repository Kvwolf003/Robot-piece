Hex Bit Holder with Vertical Rails
Overview
This 3D model is a hex bit holder designed to organize and securely hold hexagonal bits or small components. It features a base with six hexagonal cutouts and two vertical rails for additional attachment, support, or mounting purposes.
Features
✅ 6 Hexagonal Cutouts

 Designed to snugly fit standard hex bits or fasteners.


✅ Vertical Side Rails

 Useful for alignment, enclosure, or guiding a sliding part.


✅ Compact Design

 Optimized to reduce material usage while maintaining structural stability.


✅ Rounded Front Edge

 Easier handling and more ergonomic shape.


Applications
Tool organization (hex bits, screws, bolts)


Modular component holders


Mechanical or robotics support parts


Printing Recommendations
Material: PLA or PETG for general use


Layer Height: 0.2 mm


Infill: 20% (can be increased for strength)


Supports: Not required (verify for rails depending on your printer’s overhang capabilities)


Orientation: Print flat on the hex face to avoid support under rails


Customization
You can modify:
Hex hole size to match specific bit dimensions.


Add logos or labels on the flat surfaces.


Adjust rail height for enclosure-specific applications.


Notes
Ensure that the hex dimensions match the intended tool bit size (e.g., 1/4”, 6mm, etc.)


If the rails are too thin or prone to snapping, consider thickening them or adding fillets at the base.
